A few games such as 'Condemend Criminal Origins', 'FEAR' and possibly others have issues with DirectInput and have been known to tank the users FPS. This can be easily fixed by restricting only keyboard and mouse input.

In an interest to learn how to make a wrapper DLL I wanted to share my solution and in time, I may add a few improvements.
